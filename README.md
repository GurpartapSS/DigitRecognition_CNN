# DigitRecognition_CNN
Predict digits (0-9) using MNIST dataset.

Main aim of this project is to get hands on practice to manipulate inout data according to the model and analysing the keras functions for which the theory was already understood. 

Keras based sequential simple CNN model that uses ADAMAX optimizer to train over 42000 images with 784 datapoints ie. pixel values of image of (28x28x1)  
Test dataset consists of unlabeled 28000 images.

Both training and test datasets are a part of Digit Recognizer open competition by Kaggle.

Feel free to add more appropriate layers to create deeper NN.
